## ðŸš€ Introduction

Access Risk Advisor is a lightweight API that simulates **risk scoring** for access requests between users, roles, and systems.

Its goal is to serve as one part of a larger IAM system with **clean separation of concerns**, where:

- âœ… This service handles **risk evaluation**
- â¬œ A separate **API Gateway** (future) manages **authorization**
- â¬œ A **frontend** or **client** consumes the API
- â¬œ Deployment can scale from local to cloud

Inspired by solution-style .NET architectures, the service is ready to grow into a multi-layered system with low coupling and clean interfaces.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- [x] REST API to evaluate access requests
- [x] Rule-based scoring (e.g., self-request, role mismatch)
- [x] Custom response model with decision + reason
- [x] Input validation with detailed errors
- [x] Global exception handling
- [x] Swagger UI for testing

---

## ðŸ“š API Documentation

Once the app is running locally:

ðŸ”— **Swagger UI:**  
[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

Try:
- `POST /access-request` to evaluate access
- `GET /access-request/{id}` to review a decision

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
./mvnw test
```
Tests include:

âœ… Validation failures (missing fields)

âœ… Service logic (approve vs flag)

âœ… Controller integration

â¬œ Authorization layer (planned)

â¬œ Persistence layer (planned)
