## ðŸš€ Introduction

Access Risk Advisor is a lightweight API that simulates **risk scoring** for access requests between users, roles, and systems.

Its goal is to serve as one part of a larger IAM system with **clean separation of concerns**, where:

- âœ… This service handles **risk evaluation** with rule-based logic
- â¬œ It contains three business components:
-
    - **Account Management** for company, user and role management
-
    - **Access Request Evaluation** for risk evaluation logic
-
    - **Reporting** for decision history and analytics
- â¬œ An **extensible and pluggable** risk evaluation engine to allow custom rules
- â¬œ A separate **API Gateway** (future) manages **authorization**
- â¬œ A **client** runner app generating sample requests to consume the API
- â¬œ Deployment can scale from local to cloud
---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- [x] REST API to evaluate access requests
- [x] Rule-based scoring (e.g., self-request, role mismatch)
- [x] Custom response model with decision + reason
- [x] Input validation with detailed errors
- [x] Global exception handling
- [x] Swagger UI for testing

---

## ðŸ“š API Documentation

Once the app is running locally:

ðŸ”— **Swagger UI:**  
[http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

Try:
- `POST /access-request` to evaluate access
- `GET /access-request/{id}` to review a decision

## ðŸ§ª Testing

```bash
./mvnw test
```
Tests include:

âœ… Validation failures (missing fields)

âœ… Service logic (approve vs flag)

âœ… Controller integration

â¬œ Authorization layer (planned)

âœ… Persistence layer
